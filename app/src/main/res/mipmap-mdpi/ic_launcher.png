/**
 * <p>A {@code DomainObjectCollection} is a specialised {@link Collection} that adds the ability to receive modification notifications and use live filtered sub collections.</p>
 *
 * <p>The filtered collections returned by the filtering methods, such as {@link #matching(Closure)}, return collections that are <em>live</em>. That is, they reflect
 * changes made to the source collection that they were created from. This is true for filtered collections made from filtered collections etc.</p>
 * <p>
 * You can also add actions which are executed as elements are added to the collection. Actions added to filtered collections will be fired if an addition/removal
 * occurs for the source collection that matches the filter.</p>
 * <p>
 * {@code DomainObjectCollection} instances are not <em>thread-safe</em> and undefined behavior may result from the invocation of any method on a collection that is being mutated by another
 * thread; this includes direct invocations, passing the collection to a method that might perform invocations, and using an existing iterator to examine the collection.
 * </p>

 * @param <T> The type of domain objects in this collection.
